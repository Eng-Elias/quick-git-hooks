- üìù Comprehensive documentation and guides
- ‚ú® Pre-configured hooks for:
  - Code formatting (black, prettier)
  - Linting (flake8, eslint)
  - Import sorting (isort)
  - Commit message formatting (commitizen)
  - Branch naming conventions
- üîÑ Easy hook management and customization

## Installation

```bash
pip install quick-git-hooks
```

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to your Git repository:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Run the setup command:

   ```bash
   quick-git-hooks setup
   ```

   This will:

   - Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with recommended hooks
   - Create `GIT_HOOKS_GUIDE.md` with detailed documentation
   - Install pre-commit hooks
   - Install required tools (like commitizen)
   - Provide instructions for any missing dependencies

3. Check the setup status:

   ```bash
   quick-git-hooks check
   ```

4. Review `GIT_HOOKS_GUIDE.md` for:
   - Pre-configured git hooks and their purpose
   - Recommended branching strategy (Git Flow)
   - How to customize hooks
   - Common commands and troubleshooting

## Commands

### Setup

```bash
quick-git-hooks setup [--overwrite]  # Set up hooks (--overwrite to replace existing config)
```

### Check

```bash
quick-git-hooks check  # Verify setup and dependencies
```

### Run Hooks Manually

```bash
quick-git-hooks run hooks  # Run all hooks on all files
```

### Skip Hooks

```bash
git commit --no-verify  # Skip pre-commit and commit-msg hooks
git push --no-verify   # Skip pre-push hooks
```

## Development

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eng-Elias/quick-git-hooks
   cd quick-git-hooks
   ```

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows:
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:

   ```bash
   make install-dev
   ```

4. Available make commands:
   ```bash
   make install       # Install package from local sources
   make install-dev   # Install in editable mode with dev dependencies
   make build         # Build package distribution
   make publish       # Upload to PyPI (requires twine setup)
   make clean         # Clean build artifacts
   ```
